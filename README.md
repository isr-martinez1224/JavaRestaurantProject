<h1>Java Restaurant Project</h1>
</div>

This is a class project I made using the Java programming language in Spring 2023. The program starts in the Order class as a main menu in order to place an order for food in a virtual restaurant. You can order pizza, wings, and dessert with the total of your order being displayed at the end. When the program is terminated, the total amount of orders collected during its lifetime will be displayed for you to see.
